### Definition of Problem Management

**Problem Management** is a process within IT Service Management (ITSM) that focuses on identifying, analyzing, and addressing the root causes of incidents in order to prevent future occurrences. It aims to minimize the adverse impact of incidents caused by errors within the IT infrastructure, ensuring that service quality is maintained and improved over time.

### Objectives of Problem Management

The main objectives of Problem Management include:

1. **Root Cause Identification:**  
   To identify the underlying causes of incidents to prevent recurrence, rather than just addressing symptoms.

2. **Incident Prevention:**  
   To reduce the number and impact of incidents by implementing effective solutions and preventive measures.

3. **Knowledge Base Creation:**  
   To document known errors and their resolutions in a knowledge base, facilitating quicker incident resolution and enabling better decision-making.

4. **Improved Service Quality:**  
   To enhance the overall quality and reliability of IT services by resolving issues at their source, leading to fewer disruptions for users.

5. **Coordination with Other Processes:**  
   To work closely with Incident Management, Change Management, and other ITSM processes to ensure a holistic approach to service improvement.

6. **Regular Review and Improvement:**  
   To continually analyze incidents and problems, using data to drive improvements in service management practices.

7. **Communication with Stakeholders:**  
   To keep stakeholders informed about known issues, workarounds, and progress towards resolution, ensuring transparency and trust.

8. **Mitigation of Risks:**  
   To identify potential risks that could lead to future incidents and implement strategies to mitigate them.

By focusing on these objectives, Problem Management plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability and reliability of IT services, ultimately supporting the organization's goals and enhancing user satisfaction.
