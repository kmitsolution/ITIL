### Case Study: Problem Management at XYZ Corp

**Company Background:**  
XYZ Corp is a mid-sized financial services company that relies heavily on its IT infrastructure for daily operations, including client transactions, reporting, and customer service. Recently, they have been experiencing frequent disruptions in their online banking system, leading to increased customer complaints and operational inefficiencies.

### Problem Management Process

#### 1. Problem Detection and Logging

**Incident Logging:**
Over a period of two months, the IT Service Desk logs numerous incidents related to the online banking system, including:
- Users unable to access their accounts during peak hours.
- System crashes during transaction processing.

**Pattern Recognition:**
The Incident Management team notices that there are spikes in incidents every Friday afternoon, coinciding with increased transaction volumes. They decide to escalate the situation for further investigation, indicating a potential underlying problem.

**Logging the Problem:**
A formal Problem Record is created in the ITSM tool to track this issue, including initial symptoms and associated incidents.

#### 2. Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

**Data Collection:**
The Problem Management team gathers data from:
- Incident logs.
- System performance metrics.
- User feedback from the service desk.

**Analysis Techniques:**
The team employs the “5 Whys” technique:
1. **Why are users unable to access their accounts?**
   - The system crashes during peak times.
2. **Why does the system crash?**
   - The server load exceeds its capacity.
3. **Why does the server load exceed capacity?**
   - The load balancer is not effectively distributing traffic.
4. **Why isn’t the load balancer effective?**
   - Configuration settings were not optimized following a recent software update.
5. **Why were the settings not optimized?**
   - The update did not include an assessment of traffic patterns.

**Root Cause Identified:**
The RCA concludes that the root cause of the problem is related to the load balancer's configuration after a recent software update, which failed to accommodate peak usage patterns.

#### 3. Known Error Database (KEDB) and Resolution

**Documentation in KEDB:**
The Problem Management team documents the findings in the KEDB:
- **Known Error:** Online banking system crashes during peak transaction periods.
- **Root Cause:** Load balancer misconfiguration post-software update.
- **Temporary Workaround:** Redirect users to a secondary server during peak hours.
- **Permanent Resolution Plan:** Schedule a configuration review and adjustment of the load balancer settings.

**Implementation of Resolution:**
- **Workaround Communication:** The IT team communicates the temporary workaround to users, advising them to access the secondary server during peak hours.
- **Permanent Fix:** A week later, after testing the configuration adjustments, the IT team updates the load balancer settings to improve traffic distribution.

#### 4. Post-Implementation Review

**Review Meeting:**
A review meeting is scheduled two weeks after the permanent fix:
- **Participants:** Problem Management team, Incident Management team, Service Desk, and a representative from the IT infrastructure team.
- **Metrics Evaluated:**
  - Incident rates before and after the fix.
  - User feedback on system stability.

**Results:**
- The number of incidents related to the online banking system decreases significantly.
- User feedback indicates improved access and satisfaction.

**Lessons Learned:**
- The team recognizes the importance of regularly reviewing system configurations after updates.
- They decide to implement routine checks on load balancer settings, especially after significant updates.

### Conclusion

Through effective Problem Management practices, XYZ Corp successfully identified and resolved the root cause of disruptions in their online banking system. By documenting the issue in the KEDB, providing a temporary workaround, and implementing a permanent fix, the organization improved service quality and customer satisfaction. This case highlights the importance of a structured Problem Management process in maintaining IT service reliability and operational efficiency.
