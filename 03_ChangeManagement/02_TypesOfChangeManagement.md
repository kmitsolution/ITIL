In Change Management, changes are typically categorized into three main types: **Standard**, **Emergency**, and **Normal** changes. Each type has distinct characteristics and processes associated with it.

### 1. Standard Change

**Definition:**  
A Standard Change is a pre-approved change that is low risk, well-understood, and frequently repeated. These changes follow a documented process and are considered routine.

**Characteristics:**
- **Low Risk:** Standard changes have a proven track record of success and minimal impact.
- **Pre-Approved:** They are approved in advance, usually through a Change Management process.
- **Documented Procedure:** A standard operating procedure (SOP) is available for implementing these changes.

**Examples:**
- Adding a new user to a system.
- Routine software updates or patches.
- Hardware replacements that follow a set procedure.

### 2. Emergency Change

**Definition:**  
An Emergency Change is a change that needs to be implemented as soon as possible to resolve an urgent issue or to prevent significant disruption to services.

**Characteristics:**
- **Urgent Nature:** Requires rapid action to mitigate risks or resolve critical incidents.
- **Expedited Approval Process:** While still needing approval, the process is fast-tracked to allow for immediate action.
- **Post-Implementation Review:** Usually requires a review after implementation to assess the impact and effectiveness.

**Examples:**
- Fixing a critical security vulnerability.
- Restoring services after a major incident.
- Addressing system failures that affect business operations.

### 3. Normal Change

**Definition:**  
A Normal Change is any change that does not fit the criteria of a Standard or Emergency Change. These changes go through the full Change Management process, including assessment, approval, and planning.

**Characteristics:**
- **Moderate Risk:** May involve varying levels of risk and impact, requiring thorough assessment.
- **Approval Required:** Must go through the Change Advisory Board (CAB) or equivalent for approval.
- **Detailed Planning:** Requires detailed planning and documentation before implementation.

**Examples:**
- Major upgrades to software or systems.
- Changes to network infrastructure.
- Implementing new IT services or applications.

### Summary

- **Standard Change:** Low risk, pre-approved, routine.
- **Emergency Change:** Urgent, fast-tracked approval, necessary to resolve critical issues.
- **Normal Change:** Moderate risk, requires full approval process and detailed planning.

Understanding these types helps organizations manage changes effectively while balancing risk and business needs.
