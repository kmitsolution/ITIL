### Case Study: Implementing a New CRM System in IT Service Management (ITSM)

**Company Background:**  
ABC Corp is a mid-sized sales and marketing firm that has been using an outdated Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system for several years. The system lacks critical features for tracking customer interactions and analytics, leading to decreased sales productivity and customer satisfaction.

### Change Management Process

#### 1. Change Request

**Initiator:**  
The Sales Manager, after several team discussions and a demonstration of potential CRM solutions, identifies the need for a new CRM system.

**Change Request Details:**
- **Title:** Implementation of a New CRM System
- **Description:** Transition from the current CRM to a new, feature-rich system that integrates with existing tools and improves customer tracking.
- **Justification:** The current CRM is inefficient, resulting in lost sales opportunities and poor customer follow-up.
- **Potential Risks:** 
  - Data migration issues (loss of data or corruption).
  - User resistance to adopting the new system.

**Submission:**  
The Sales Manager submits the Change Request through the organization's ITSM tool, which captures all necessary details and automatically notifies the Change Advisory Board (CAB).

#### 2. Change Evaluation and Approval

**CAB Review:**
- **Participants:** IT Manager, Sales Manager, a representative from the Finance department, and a Systems Analyst.
- **Assessment Process:**
  - **Impact Analysis:** 
    - **Operational Impact:** High, as the sales team heavily relies on the CRM for daily operations.
    - **Business Impact:** Improvement in customer service and sales efficiency anticipated.
  - **Risk Assessment:** 
    - Moderate risk due to data migration and the learning curve for the new system.
    - Mitigation strategies include robust data backup, training sessions, and a phased rollout.

**Approval Outcome:**  
The CAB approves the Change Request with conditions: a detailed migration plan, user training sessions, and a scheduled review post-implementation.

#### 3. Change Implementation and Review

**Implementation Plan:**
- **Timeline:** The rollout is planned for four weeks.
- **Tasks:**
  - **Week 1:** Data migration preparation.
  - **Week 2:** Execute data migration.
  - **Week 3:** Training sessions for the sales team.
  - **Week 4:** Go live with the new CRM.

**Execution:**
- **Data Migration:**
  - The IT team works with the vendor to ensure a smooth migration, conducting tests to verify data integrity.
  - A full backup of the old CRM data is created before migration begins.

- **Training:**
  - Conducted multiple training sessions for all sales staff, using hands-on demonstrations of the new CRM features.
  - A feedback form is distributed to gather input on the training process.

- **Go Live:**
  - The new CRM goes live during a low-activity period to minimize disruption.
  - IT support is on standby for any immediate issues that arise post-launch.

**Review:**
- **Post-Implementation Review Meeting:**
  - **Participants:** CAB members, Sales Manager, and IT team.
  - **Metrics Evaluated:**
    - User adoption rates: 85% of the sales team logged into the new system within the first week.
    - Customer feedback: Initial surveys show a 20% improvement in customer satisfaction due to better tracking and response times.
    - Sales productivity: Preliminary data indicates a 15% increase in sales activities tracked through the new CRM.

- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Ensure that future training sessions are tailored to different user skill levels.
  - Establish a clearer communication plan to manage user expectations before going live.

**Documentation:**
- All findings, including success metrics, user feedback, and areas for improvement, are documented in the ITSM tool for future reference.

### Conclusion

The implementation of a new CRM system at ABC Corp illustrates an effective Change Management process within ITSM. By systematically managing the Change Request, carefully evaluating and approving the change, and executing a detailed implementation plan, the organization successfully transitioned to a more efficient CRM system. This case study highlights the importance of structured change management in enhancing service quality, user satisfaction, and overall business performance.
