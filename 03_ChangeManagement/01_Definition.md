### ITSM Definition

**IT Service Management (ITSM)** refers to the set of practices, policies, and procedures that organizations use to design, deliver, manage, and improve the way IT services are used within an organization. ITSM focuses on aligning IT services with the needs of the business and emphasizes customer satisfaction and continual improvement.

### Objectives of Change Management

Change Management is a crucial component of ITSM, aimed at ensuring that changes to IT services and systems are implemented in a controlled and efficient manner. The primary objectives of Change Management include:

1. **Minimize Disruption:** Ensure that changes are made with minimal impact on service quality and availability.

2. **Reduce Risk:** Assess and mitigate risks associated with changes, ensuring that potential negative effects are understood and managed.

3. **Standardize Procedures:** Establish a systematic approach to manage changes, making the process predictable and repeatable.

4. **Improve Communication:** Facilitate clear communication among stakeholders about changes, including their purpose, impact, and status.

5. **Ensure Compliance:** Maintain compliance with internal policies, regulatory requirements, and industry standards during the change process.

6. **Enhance Visibility:** Provide visibility into the change process, allowing stakeholders to track and understand ongoing changes.

7. **Document Changes:** Maintain comprehensive records of changes for accountability, analysis, and future reference.

8. **Facilitate Planning and Scheduling:** Ensure changes are planned and scheduled effectively to optimize resource utilization and minimize conflicts.

9. **Promote Continuous Improvement:** Use feedback and data from past changes to refine and improve the Change Management process.

By achieving these objectives, Change Management helps organizations respond to evolving business needs while maintaining stability and reliability in IT services.
