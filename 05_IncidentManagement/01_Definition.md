### Definition of Incident Management

**Incident Management** is a key process within IT Service Management (ITSM) focused on restoring normal service operation as quickly as possible after an interruption. Its primary goal is to minimize the adverse impact of incidents on business operations while ensuring that service quality is maintained. An incident can be defined as any event that disrupts, or could disrupt, a service.

### Objectives of Incident Management

The main objectives of Incident Management include:

1. **Rapid Restoration of Service:**  
   To restore normal service operations as quickly as possible, minimizing downtime and disruption to the business.

2. **Minimize Impact on Business:**  
   To reduce the negative effects of incidents on business operations, ensuring that critical services remain available.

3. **Effective Incident Logging and Categorization:**  
   To ensure all incidents are logged, categorized, and prioritized correctly for efficient handling and resolution.

4. **Efficient Resource Utilization:**  
   To ensure that appropriate resources are allocated to incidents based on their priority and impact, optimizing response times.

5. **Communication with Stakeholders:**  
   To keep users and stakeholders informed about the status of incidents, expected resolution times, and any workarounds available.

6. **Continual Improvement:**  
   To identify trends and patterns in incidents, which can inform future preventive measures and improvements to services and processes.

7. **Collaboration with Other Processes:**  
   To ensure that Incident Management works effectively with other ITSM processes, such as Problem Management and Change Management, to facilitate better overall service delivery.

8. **Documentation and Knowledge Management:**  
   To document incidents, resolutions, and workarounds in a knowledge base, enabling faster resolution of similar incidents in the future.

By achieving these objectives, Incident Management helps organizations maintain service quality, enhance user satisfaction, and support overall business continuity.
