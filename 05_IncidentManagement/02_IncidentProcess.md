### Incident Management Process

The Incident Management process consists of several key stages that ensure efficient handling of incidents to restore normal service operations. The main stages include **Incident Detection and Logging**, **Incident Classification and Prioritization**, and **Incident Resolution and Closure**. Here’s a detailed overview of each stage:

#### 1. Incident Detection and Logging

**Definition:**  
This stage involves identifying incidents and logging them into the Incident Management system for further action.

**Process:**
- **Detection:** Incidents can be detected through various means, including:
  - User reports via the service desk.
  - Monitoring tools that alert IT staff to performance issues or outages.
  - Automated alerts generated by IT systems.
  
- **Logging:** Once detected, incidents must be logged promptly. Essential details include:
  - **User Information:** Who reported the incident?
  - **Incident Description:** What is the nature of the incident?
  - **Time of Detection:** When was the incident reported?
  - **Affected Services:** Which services are impacted?

**Example:**  
A user reports that they cannot access their email account. The service desk logs this incident in the ITSM tool, capturing details such as the user's name, a description of the problem, the time it was reported, and the affected service (email).

#### 2. Incident Classification and Prioritization

**Definition:**  
In this stage, incidents are classified and prioritized based on their impact and urgency to determine the appropriate response.

**Process:**
- **Classification:** Incidents are categorized into predefined categories (e.g., hardware, software, network) to streamline the resolution process.
- **Prioritization:** Incidents are assigned a priority level, typically using a matrix that considers both the impact on the business and the urgency of the issue:
  - **Impact:** How many users are affected? What is the severity of the incident?
  - **Urgency:** How quickly does the incident need to be resolved?

**Example:**  
Using the earlier incident of the email access issue:
- **Classification:** The incident is categorized as a “Software Incident” related to email services.
- **Prioritization:** If the user is a key executive and email access is critical for their work, the incident may be classified as High Priority due to its significant impact and urgency.

#### 3. Incident Resolution and Closure

**Definition:**  
This stage involves resolving the incident and formally closing it after ensuring that the service has been restored.

**Process:**
- **Investigation and Diagnosis:** IT staff investigate the incident to identify the root cause and possible solutions. This may involve checking logs, running diagnostics, or consulting knowledge bases.
- **Resolution:** Implement the identified solution to restore service. This could include:
  - Fixing a configuration issue.
  - Replacing faulty hardware.
  - Providing users with a workaround.
  
- **Closure:** After resolution, the incident is closed. Key steps include:
  - **Documentation:** Record the resolution details and any steps taken.
  - **User Confirmation:** Verify with the user that the incident has been resolved to their satisfaction.
  - **Update the Knowledge Base:** If applicable, document the solution in the knowledge base for future reference.

**Example:**  
For the email access incident:
- **Investigation:** The IT team discovers that a recent system update caused a configuration error in the email server.
- **Resolution:** They quickly roll back the update and restore email access.
- **Closure:** The service desk confirms with the user that access is restored, documents the resolution in the ITSM tool, and closes the incident.

### Summary

- **Incident Detection and Logging:** Identify and log incidents as they occur, capturing essential details.
- **Incident Classification and Prioritization:** Classify and prioritize incidents based on impact and urgency to determine the appropriate response.
- **Incident Resolution and Closure:** Investigate, resolve the incident, and formally close it, ensuring proper documentation and user confirmation.

By following these steps, organizations can efficiently manage incidents, reduce downtime, and enhance overall service delivery.
