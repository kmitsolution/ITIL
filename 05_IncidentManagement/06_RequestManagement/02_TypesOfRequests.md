### Types of Requests in Request Management

Request Management typically handles a variety of requests from users, which can be broadly categorized into different types. The two main types of requests are **Service Requests** and **Information Requests**.

#### 1. Service Requests

**Definition:**  
Service Requests are formal requests from users for something to be provided or changed within IT services. These requests typically involve the fulfillment of a service, such as the provision of new hardware, software installations, or changes to user access permissions.

**Examples of Service Requests:**
- **New Hardware:** Requesting a new laptop or desktop computer for a new employee.
- **Software Installation:** Requesting the installation of specific software applications (e.g., antivirus software or productivity tools).
- **Access Requests:** Requesting access to specific systems, applications, or networks (e.g., access to a file share or a restricted application).
- **Account Changes:** Requests to update user account details, such as changing a username or resetting a password.
- **Configuration Changes:** Requests to configure or customize a service to meet user needs (e.g., adjusting settings in a software application).

**Characteristics:**
- Generally have predefined workflows and approvals.
- Often involve coordination with other ITSM processes (e.g., Change Management).
- Can be fulfilled according to service level agreements (SLAs).

#### 2. Information Requests

**Definition:**  
Information Requests are requests from users seeking information or clarification about services, processes, or systems. These requests do not involve a change to services but rather the provision of knowledge or guidance.

**Examples of Information Requests:**
- **Service Catalog Inquiry:** Asking for details about available IT services or how to access the service catalog.
- **Policy Clarification:** Requesting clarification on IT policies, such as security policies or acceptable use policies.
- **Technical Support Questions:** Inquiring about how to use a specific software feature or troubleshooting steps for an application.
- **Status Updates:** Requesting the status of a previously submitted service request or incident.

**Characteristics:**
- Typically do not require formal approval processes.
- Focus on knowledge sharing and communication.
- Can be fulfilled quickly by providing information or directing users to relevant resources.

### Summary

Understanding the different types of requests—**Service Requests** and **Information Requests**—is essential for effective Request Management. By categorizing requests appropriately, organizations can streamline their processes, enhance user satisfaction, and ensure efficient resource allocation.
