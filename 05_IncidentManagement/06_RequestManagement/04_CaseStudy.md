### Case Study: Request Management at XYZ Financial Services

**Company Background:**  
XYZ Financial Services is a mid-sized company providing investment and banking services to clients. With a growing number of employees and a diverse range of IT services, effective Request Management is critical for maintaining operational efficiency and user satisfaction.

### Scenario: Employee Onboarding Process

#### Incident Overview

As part of their onboarding process for new employees, XYZ Financial Services manages various requests for IT resources, including hardware, software, and access to systems. The company noticed delays and inconsistencies in fulfilling these requests, leading to frustration among new hires and their managers.

### Request Management Process

#### 1. Request Logging and Categorization

**Detection:**
- New employees submit requests through an internal service portal designed for onboarding. Requests include items such as:
  - New laptops.
  - Software installations (e.g., productivity tools, security software).
  - Access to necessary systems (e.g., email, project management tools).

**Logging:**
- Requests are logged into the IT Service Management (ITSM) tool, capturing:
  - Employee name.
  - Department.
  - Specific items requested.
  - Submission date and time.

**Categorization:**
- The IT team categorizes requests as follows:
  - **Hardware Requests:** New laptops or desktops.
  - **Software Requests:** Installation of applications.
  - **Access Requests:** Permissions for systems or applications.

**Example:**
A new marketing employee submits a request for a laptop and access to the marketing CRM system. The service desk logs the request, categorizing it as a "Hardware Request" and an "Access Request."

#### 2. Request Approval and Fulfillment

**Request Approval:**
- Certain requests, especially those involving hardware, require approval from the department manager to ensure budget compliance.
- The ITSM tool automatically routes the requests to the appropriate manager for approval.

**Example:**
The request for the new laptop is sent to the marketing manager for approval. The manager reviews the request and approves it based on the need for the new hire to have the necessary equipment.

**Request Fulfillment:**
- After approval, the IT team processes the request. This involves:
  - Ordering the laptop from a pre-approved vendor.
  - Configuring the laptop with necessary software.
  - Setting up access to the CRM system.

**Communication:**
- The IT team keeps the employee and their manager informed throughout the process. They provide updates when the laptop is ordered and when it is ready for pickup.

**Example:**
Once the laptop is configured, the IT team sends an email to the new employee and their manager, informing them that the laptop is ready and providing instructions for accessing the CRM system.

### Post-Implementation Review

**Review Meeting:**
- After implementing the new Request Management process, XYZ Financial Services holds a review meeting to evaluate the changes.

**Evaluation:**
- Metrics are assessed, including:
  - Average time to fulfill requests.
  - User satisfaction ratings from new employees.
  - Number of escalated requests.

**Results:**
- The average fulfillment time for hardware requests decreased from 10 days to 3 days.
- User satisfaction scores improved significantly, with new employees reporting a smoother onboarding experience.

**Lessons Learned:**
- The team recognizes the need for continuous training on the ITSM tool for both the IT staff and department managers to ensure efficient processing of requests.
- They also identify opportunities for further automation in the approval process to reduce delays.

### Conclusion

Through the implementation of an effective Request Management process, XYZ Financial Services improved the efficiency of their employee onboarding. By streamlining request logging, categorization, approval, and fulfillment, the organization enhanced user satisfaction and operational effectiveness. This case underscores the importance of a structured Request Management approach in fostering a positive workplace environment and supporting business objectives.
